### Question:
>Consider the following problem:
>
>             (a) Min Z = –3X1 + X2
>
>Subject to the following:
>
>             (b) X1 + X2 ≤ 5
>
>             (c) 2X1 + X2 ≤ 8  
>
>             (d) X1 ≥ 0, X2 ≥ 0 
>
>What is the optimal solution?
### Solution:
In this problem, I will use graphical method to achieve. 
  
First, we could plotting the region satisfies all the constraints, shown as quadrilateral ABCD.

We could change equation (a) to this format:
  
  
             (a) Z = -3X1 + X2 
           
          -> (e) X2 = 3X1 + Z
  
The coefficient of this equation is 3 and the intersection of this function(e) and X2-axis is the value of Z.
  
Moving fuction(e) inside the the constrained area, when X1 = 4, X2 = 0, Z reaches it's MIN value, which is -12.
  
Therefore, the optimal solution is :
  
X1 = 4,  X2 = 0, Z = -12
